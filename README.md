- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized price distributions across cities.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Performed ANOVA to test if price distributions differ across cities.
- **Regression Modeling**: Ran multiple linear regression using city, number of bedrooms, and accommodates as predictors.
